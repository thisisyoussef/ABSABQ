## Project Overview

ABSABQ is designed to provide superior binary data processing capabilities to developers. It is implemented in C# and uses innovative data structures and algorithms to deliver high-quality performance. The main components of this project are:

1. BinaryFileIO: A C# solution for reading and writing binary data.
2. Advanced Binary Serialization: A module that allows developers to perform advanced serialization and deserialization of complex data structures.
3. Binary Query: A powerful query language that enables developers to efficiently query and manipulate binary data.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with ABSABQ, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository by running: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/ABSABQ.git
   ```
2. Open the BinaryFileIO.sln file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the solution.

## Usage Guide

To use ABSABQ, simply include the relevant namespaces in your project and follow the provided examples:

1. For BinaryFileIO, include the namespace:
   ```csharp
   using ABSABQ.IO;
   ```
   
2. For Advanced Binary Serialization, include the namespace:
   ```csharp
   using ABSABQ.Serialization;
   ```
   
3. For Binary Query, include the namespace:
   ```csharp
   using ABSABQ.Query;
   ```

Detailed documentation and examples can be found in each module's respective directory within the repository.
